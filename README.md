# RLTrials
This project will contain a interface from which trials of Reinforcement Learning(RL) algorithms can be run. The purpose is to have all implementations of RL made over the course of my current research in one place, with examples. 

The start of the project will be a simple RL algorithm, representing a RL solution to the travelling salesman problem. The main goal is to show the primary graph of the problem, and an efficiency graph to show how long it took to learn the way.
